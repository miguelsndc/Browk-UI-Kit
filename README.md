# Browk UI KIT

## About The Project

### !! Project is still under development !!

As a quite new frontend developer, i'm used to build a project from the ground up, but that's not how things work in a real work environment. That's why i decided to learn Storybook, a awesome tool that help us fronties build, test and validate ui components in isolation, which really makes the job easier. As a real world tool, i believe that the knowledge i acquired now will help me a lot in the future.

Take a look at the hosted project [here](https://6164774f432769004a67b74d-xvgjsfipzy.chromatic.com/), i'm updating it constantly.

Here's what i learned:

- What is and how to use Storybook
